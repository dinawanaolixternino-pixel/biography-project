        <h2 style="color: #2d6a4f; border-left-color: #2d6a4f;">Childhood Years</h2>
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup> I grew up in a quiet province called <b>Mahayag</b> in Zamboanga del Sur. 
            <sup>2</sup> My parents were away working, so I lived with my <i>Lolo</i> and <i>Lola</i> in their simple home. 
            <sup>3</sup> Life there was very peaceful, but honestly, it was quite lonely sometimes. 
            <sup>4</sup> Our house was situated on a large farm, and the neighbors were really far away from us. 
            <sup>5</sup> Because of the vast distance, it was rare to see other kids my age outside playing. 
            <sup>6</sup> Most of the time, my only playmates were the stray cats and dogs in our yard. 
            <sup>7</sup> The only time our house felt truly lively was when my cousins came to visit us. 
            <sup>8</sup> One time, I even threw my cousin's slippers away because I didn't want them to go home. 
            <sup>9</sup> I cried so hard that time because I knew that I would get lonely again once they left. 
            <sup>10</sup> But because I was mostly alone, I eventually learned to love the small things around me. 
            <sup>11</sup> I loved sitting on the porch just watching the chickens eat their food in the dirt. 
            <sup>12</sup> Feeding the pigs became a daily routine that I actually looked forward to every morning. 
            <sup>13</sup> My favorite bonding moment was going fishing with my <i>Lolo</i> at the nearby river. 
            <sup>14</sup> Sometimes we caught a fish for dinner, and sometimes we went home with nothing. 
            <sup>15</sup> I also remember a specific season when many butterflies would suddenly appear inside our house. 
            <sup>16</sup> It was such a beautiful sight since there were many butterflies with different bright colors. 
            <sup>17</sup> When it was almost nighttime, my grandfather and I would walk back home together slowly. 
            <sup>18</sup> As we approached, I could smell the delicious food my <i>Lola</i> was cooking for us. 
            <sup>19</sup> We would eat together by the light of a lamp, telling stories about our day.
            <sup>20</sup> It was sad not having playmates, but looking back, my childhood was truly beautiful.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: #40916c; border-left-color: #40916c;">Teenage Years</h2>
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup> When I was a teenager, high school was full of fun, awkward moments, and unforgettable memories. 
            <sup>2</sup> I remember back in Grade 8, I joined a school pageant just to be exempted from subjects. 
            <sup>3</sup> Walking on that stage was terrifying, and I honestly regretted signing up immediately. 
            <sup>4</sup> My knees were shaking the whole time, and I felt so shy in front of the crowd. 
            <sup>5</sup> However, it remains a fun memory because it was my first time trying something so brave. 
            <sup>6</sup> High school was very different from the quiet life I had in the province. 
            <sup>7</sup> I made new friends who were loud, crazy, and always ready for fun adventures. 
            <sup>8</sup> We loved hanging out at the canteen during recess just to talk about random things. 
            <sup>9</sup> After school, my friends and I often went to <strong>Lemon Square</strong> to buy food. 
            <sup>10</sup> We would also play mobile games and scream in excitement whenever we won a tough match. 
            <sup>11</sup> I also remember that I really liked my Science and Math teacher back then. 
            <sup>12</sup> I would always raise my hand during class just to catch her attention. 
            <sup>13</sup> I even studied so hard just so I could answer many of her questions correctly. 
            <sup>14</sup> It makes me laugh now thinking about the effort I made just to impress her. 
            <sup>15</sup> Then, the <em>COVID-19</em> pandemic suddenly arrived and changed everything for all of us. 
            <sup>16</sup> It was really sad because I wasn’t able to enjoy the rest of my high school life. 
            <sup>17</sup> We were stuck at home and missed out on many events we were looking forward to. 
            <sup>18</sup> The graduation ceremony we dreamed of never happened in the way we expected.
            <sup>19</sup> Despite the abrupt ending, I am still grateful for the short time we had together. 
            <sup>20</sup> High school was incomplete, but the memories we made before the lockdown are forever.

        <h2 style="color: #52b788; border-left-color: #52b788;">College Years</h2>
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup> Stepping into college was a confusing time because my life plans suddenly changed. 
            <sup>2</sup> I actually wanted to study <strong>Nursing</strong> to help take care of sick people. 
            <sup>3</sup> But I only applied to two schools, which were <strong>PLM</strong> and <strong>UE</strong>, hoping for the best. 
            <sup>4</sup> Sadly, there were no slots left for nursing at PLM, which really broke my heart. 
            <sup>5</sup> Since I had limited options, I decided to enroll at <strong>UE</strong> in Caloocan instead. 
            <sup>6</sup> I ended up taking <strong>Computer Science</strong>, a path I never really expected to walk on. 
            <sup>7</sup> I quickly realized that this course was much harder than I imagined it would be. 
            <sup>8</sup> Programming is not just about typing; it requires deep logic and a lot of patience. 
            <sup>9</sup> I remember feeling happy when I wrote my first code, but that was just the start. 
            <sup>10</sup> There are days when I stare at my screen for hours finding a missing semicolon. 
            <sup>11</sup> It is very frustrating when the program has errors and I cannot fix them immediately. 
            <sup>12</sup> I often stay up very late at night just to finish my complex coding assignments. 
            <sup>13</sup> Sometimes I forget to eat or sleep because I am too focused on the monitor. 
            <sup>14</sup> Thankfully, I met new friends who are also struggling with the same hard subjects. 
            <sup>15</sup> We help each other debug code and study for the difficult major exams.
            <sup>16</sup> Aside from coding, I also enjoy learning how to design layouts and create wireframes. 
            <sup>17</sup> There are moments when I honestly ask myself if this course is right for me. 
            <sup>18</sup> But every time I finally solve a bug, I feel a huge rush of excitement. 
            <sup>19</sup> I am learning to accept this new path and not give up on challenges. 
            <sup>20</sup> Although I didn't become a nurse, I am excited to become a successful developer now.
